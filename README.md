# TextRPG
A simple, WIP text-rpg/adventure game. With this "project", my goal was to further my understanding of core game elements like inventory, level systems, stat-modifiers, etc. It is by no means a complete product, and I plan to expand on it in the future. For now, see it is a demonstration of my understanding of fundamental programming logic and simple algorithms.
